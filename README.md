# Deepchecks Monitoring üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Deepchecks Monitoring is an open source service üì¶ that allows you to monitor machine learning models, 
get alerts when they fail and perform root cause analysis once a problem was detected.

Deepchecks has a full solution for continous ML validation. Which means that you can use the tests
from your testing and CI/CD testing suites as the base for the tests in your monitoring environment. 
The [deepchecks](https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks) checks (which are the infrastructure of monitors) and suites
can be customized and adapted to the monitoring service.

Moreover, when you focus on an issue that requires code level analysis, you can launch the full testing 
package, with the relevant data on your Python environmen and continue the root cause analysis in your
"home" environment.

Deepchecks Monitoring provides a comprehensive solution for detecting data and model drift, 
monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) üìä, and alerting when anomalies are detected üîî.


### Deepchecks Open-source deployment
Deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux/MacOS (Windows is WIP!) with Docker:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepchecks/monitoring/main/deploy/deploy-oss.sh)"
```

This will automatically download the necessary dependencies and start the application locally.
Installing our open-source service is an excellent way to test the service locally. However, this won't scale to support
real-time production usage.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
The DeepChecks Monitoring application can be configured by environment variables. 
The configuration file .env contains settings for the data sources, models, and KPIs that should be monitored.

## Contributing ü§ù
