Deploying on AWS EC2

Installing our open source solution on your AWS servers allows you to enjoy a reliable solution, limited to 1 model, with Amazon grade security that is accessible to the relevant teams in your organization. Our minimal configuration includes a secure environment.
For a more scalable installation, you should use our on-premise version, which allows you to use more than 1 model , have integration with your company's authentication and authorization services and several other features that are not available in the open-source distribution. reach out to us at : customersuccess@deepchecks.com
