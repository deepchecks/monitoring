Demos
=====

These demos are end-to-end examples of how you can use Deepchecks to detect problems with your models and data and
investigate them. They all start by showing how the relevant data can be sent to Deepchecks, and then proceed to
demonstrate how the various dashboards, alerts and other screens can be used to review potential problems and
discover their root causes.

To make the best use of these demos, you may want to explore the demo case that most resembles your own use-case. You
can also skip right to the end of each demo if you're only interested in using the system screens.
