        Tests and continuous monitoring during production
        

Deechecks' continuous validation approach is based on testing the ML models and data throughout their lifecycle
using the exact same checks, enabling a simple, elaborate and seamless experience for configuring and consuming the results.
Each phase has its relevant interfaces (e.g. visual outputs, python/json output results, alert configuration, push notifications, RCA, etc.) for
interacting with the test results.
