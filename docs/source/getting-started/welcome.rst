        Tests and continuous monitoring during production
        

Deepchecks accompanies you through various testing needs such as verifying your data's integrity, 
inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model and comparing between different models,
throughout the model's lifecycle.

   :alt: Phases for Continuous Validation of ML Models and Data
   :align: center

|

Deechecks' continuous validation approach is based on testing the ML models and data throughout the different phases 
using the exact same checks, enabling a simple, elaborate and seamless experience for configuring and consuming the results.
Each phase has its relevant interfaces (e.g. visual outputs, output results to json, alert configuration, push notifications, RCA, etc.) for
interacting with the test results.
