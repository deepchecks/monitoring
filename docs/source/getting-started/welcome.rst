        Tests and continuous monitoring during production
        

Deepchecks provides comprehensive support for your testing requirements,
from examining data integrity and assessing distributions,
to validating data splits, comparing models and evaluating their 
performance across the model's entire development process.

   :align: center

Deechecks' continuous validation approach is based on testing the ML models and data throughout their lifecycle
using the exact same checks, enabling a simple, elaborate and seamless experience for configuring and consuming the results.
Each phase has its relevant interfaces (e.g. visual outputs, python/json output results, alert configuration, push notifications, RCA, etc.) for
interacting with the test results.
